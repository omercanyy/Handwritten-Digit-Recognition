# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Recognize handwritten digits, enter your own inputs on MatLab 

This was a project I did back in university for my Machine Learning class. I converted this into a project for high school AP Computer Science students to work on and unverstand complexity of neural networks after the AP test. One of my students awarded with a First Place degree in state Science Fair.
